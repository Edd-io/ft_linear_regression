# ft_linear_regression

A simple implementation of linear regression in Python to predict car prices based on mileage, as part of the 42 Network curriculum.

## 🚗 Overview

This project demonstrates the basics of machine learning by using linear regression to estimate the price of a car given its mileage. It includes two main scripts:

- `train.py` : Trains the linear regression model using a dataset of mileage and price pairs.
- `predict.py` : Uses the trained model to predict the price for a given mileage.

## ✨ Features

- Linear regression using gradient descent.
- Data normalization for improved training stability.
- Save and load model parameters.
- Shell script (`test.sh`) for automated testing.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [Standard library] No installation needed: json, sys, csv, argparse, typing
- [External libraries] Install with pip:
  - numpy : `pip install numpy`
  - matplotlib : `pip install matplotlib`

No external libraries are required; the code uses only the Python standard library.

## 🚀 Usage

**1. Train the model**

Run the training script to fit the model to your data (make sure your dataset is formatted as expected in the script):
```
python3 train.py
```

This will generate and save the model parameters (typically as a file, e.g., `thetas.csv` or similar).

**2. Predict car price**

Use the prediction script to estimate the price for a given mileage:
```
python3 predict.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the mileage, and the script will output the predicted price.

**3. Automated Testing**

You can use the provided shell script to run tests:
```
bash test.sh
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **Linear Regression:** The model fits a line to the data using the equation:
```
price = theta0 + theta1 * mileage
```


- **Gradient Descent:** The training process iteratively updates the parameters (theta0, theta1) to minimize the prediction error.

- **Normalization:** Input data is normalized to ensure efficient and stable training.

- **Parameter Saving:** After training, the learned parameters are saved for use in prediction.

## 📝 Notes

- The dataset should be in the format expected by the scripts (typically a CSV file with mileage and price columns).
- The project is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates the core principles of linear regression without relying on external ML libraries.
